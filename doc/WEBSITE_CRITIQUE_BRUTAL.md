# BRUTAL WEBSITE CRITIQUE - goodluckoguzie.github.io

**Date:** November 5, 2024  
**Reviewed by:** AI Assistant  
**Overall Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **BROKEN LINKS** - Severity: CRITICAL ❌
- **Google Scholar link:** Empty URL (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=)
- **ORCID link:** Empty URL (https://orcid.org/)
- **ResearchGate link:** Empty URL (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/)
- **Impact:** Makes you look unprofessional. Visitors will think you don't have these profiles or you're careless.
- **Fix:** Either add real URLs or remove these links entirely.

### 2. **PLACEHOLDER TEXT** - Severity: CRITICAL ❌
Multiple pages still have placeholder text asking for user input:
- CV Page: "[Previous Degrees]" sections with "(Please provide details...)"
- About Page: "[Module Name]" placeholders for QH0328 and QHO431
- **Impact:** Looks incomplete and unprofessional. Gives impression the site is still under construction.
- **Fix:** Either fill in the real information or remove the placeholders.

### 3. **CONTENT QUALITY** - Severity: HIGH ⚠️

**Problems:**
- **TOO MUCH REPETITION:** Same projects are described on multiple pages (Home, Portfolio, Publications, Research)
- **VERBOSE WRITING:** Many paragraphs are too long and hard to scan
- **JARGON OVERLOAD:** Too much technical jargon without context
- **NO PERSONALITY:** The writing is dry and academic - there's no human voice

**Examples of problematic text:**
- Home page paragraph is 93 words in one sentence
- CV Profile section is 117 words in one paragraph
- About page bio is three dense paragraphs that repeat the same information

**Fix:** 
- Cut text by 30-40%
- Use shorter sentences
- Add personality and human elements
- Remove repetition

---

## MAJOR ISSUES (High Priority)

### 4. **READABILITY** - Severity: HIGH ⚠️

**Problems:**
- Paragraphs are too dense
- No clear visual hierarchy on some pages
- Text is not scannable
- Important information buried in walls of text

**Specific examples:**
- About page: First bio paragraph is 100+ words
- CV page: Profile section is one massive paragraph
- Portfolio: Project descriptions are too long

**Recommendations:**
- Use bullet points more
- Break paragraphs into 2-3 sentences max
- Add more white space
- Use bold for key points

### 5. **INCONSISTENT TONE** - Severity: MEDIUM ⚠️

**Problems:**
- Switches between first person ("I conduct research") and third person descriptions
- Sometimes too formal, sometimes too casual
- Not consistent across pages

**Fix:**
- Choose one voice (I recommend first person - "I develop...")
- Maintain consistent tone across all pages
- Sound professional but approachable

### 6. **NAVIGATION & USER EXPERIENCE** - Severity: MEDIUM ⚠️

**Problems:**
- Publications page still exists but isn't in the main navigation (orphaned page)
- Research page still exists but isn't in the main navigation (orphaned page)
- Teaching page still exists but isn't in the main navigation (orphaned page)
- Users clicking links from home page might end up on orphaned pages

**Fix:**
- Either add these pages back to navigation OR delete them
- Update all internal links to point to current navigation structure

## CONTENT STRUCTURE ISSUES

### 10. **HOME PAGE** - Severity: MEDIUM ⚠️

**Problems:**
- First paragraph is ONE 93-WORD SENTENCE - impossible to read
- Key Achievements stats are good but could have more context
- Featured Projects section is good
- "Latest Research Insights" section is just a "coming soon" - either remove or add real content

**Recommendations:**
- Break the hero paragraph into 3-4 shorter sentences
- Add dates to Key Achievements for context
- Remove the Insights preview if you have no content yet

### 11. **ABOUT PAGE** - Severity: MEDIUM ⚠️

**Problems:**
- Education section is redundant (PhD listed twice)
- Professional Experience has only ONE job (current position) - looks thin
- Tools & Technologies section is good
- Skills & Competencies section is good

**Recommendations:**
- Remove duplicate education section
- Add any previous positions (teaching assistant, research assistant, etc.)
- Combine similar sections to reduce redundancy

### 12. **PORTFOLIO PAGE** - Severity: LOW ✓

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured case studies ✓
- Good use of emojis for visual interest ✓
- Clear sections (Overview, Challenges, Solution, Impact) ✓

### 13. **CV PAGE** - Severity: MEDIUM ⚠️

- Profile section is 117 words in ONE paragraph - unreadable

- Very text-heavy

**Recommendations:**
- Break profile into 2-3 short paragraphs or bullet points
- Add publications section
- Add previous positions if any
- Consider visual elements (skill bars, timeline, etc.)

### 14. **INSIGHTS PAGE** - Severity: LOW ⚠️

**Problems:**
- Just a "coming soon" page
- Filter buttons don't do anything (no content)
- Email subscribe form doesn't work

**Recommendations:**
- Either add real content OR simplify this page
