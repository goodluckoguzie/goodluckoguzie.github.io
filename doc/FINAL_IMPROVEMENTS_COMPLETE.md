## ✅ ALL YOUR REQUESTED IMPROVEMENTS - DONE!

### 1. **Reduce Emojis to 2-3 Per Project** - DONE ✅

**Before:**
- 9 emojis per project (📅 🏢 👥 📊 🎯 ⚠️ 💡 📈 🛠️)
- Looked childish and overwhelming

**After:**
- 1-2 emojis per project (icon in title + status badge)
- Clean and professional

**Example:**
- Before: "### Predictive World Models..." with 9 emojis throughout
- After: "### 🤖 Predictive World Models..." with just title emoji + badge

---

### 2. **Cut Portfolio Bullets to 10-12 Per Project** - DONE ✅

**Before:**
- 18-20 bullet points per project
- Overwhelming and nobody reads them all

**After:**
- 9-12 bullet points per project
- Combined sections for efficiency
- Kept only the MOST impressive points

**Example - "Predictive World Models":**
- Before: 6 Challenges + 6 Solutions + 6 Impact = 18 bullets
- After: 4 Challenges + 5 Impact/Solution = 9 bullets total

**Result:** Much more scannable and focused!
