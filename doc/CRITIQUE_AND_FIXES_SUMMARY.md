## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES I FOUND AND FIXED

- All "View Publication →" links on home page pointed to `/publications` 
- That page was DELETED
- Clicking them gave 404 errors

**Fixed:**

- NO MENTION of Solent on LinkedIn
- This looked like lying!

**Fixed:**
- Removed all "Solent University" references
- Now shows actual jobs: QA Ltd (2024-Present), Crimson (2020-Present), Aston (2020-2024)
- Matches LinkedIn exactly

**Problem Found:**

**Fixed:**

---

### 5. WRONG "LAST UPDATED" DATE - FIXED ✅

## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES (Recommendations)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**1. TOO MANY EMOJIS on Portfolio Page**
- Current: 9 emojis per project (📅 🏢 👥 📊 🎯 ⚠️ 💡 📈 🛠️)
- Recommendation: Reduce to 2-3 per project
- Impact: Looks more mature and professional
- **Your decision** if you want to keep them

**2. PORTFOLIO BULLET POINTS TOO LONG**
- Current: 18-20 bullets per project
- Recommendation: Cut to 10-12 bullets per project
- Impact: More scannable, highlights best points
- **Your decision** on what to keep

**3. INSIGHTS PAGE IS EMPTY**
- Current: Just "Coming Soon" with fake filter buttons
- Recommendations:
  - Option A: DELETE the page entirely
  - Option B: Write 1-2 actual articles
  - Option C: Simplify to basic "Coming Soon" message
- **Your decision** on which option
