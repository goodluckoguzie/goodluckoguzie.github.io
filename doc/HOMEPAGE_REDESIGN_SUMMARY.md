# 🎯 HOMEPAGE REDESIGN SUMMARY

## Current Problems (Brutal Truth)

### ❌ TOO COMPLEX
- 6 major sections competing for attention
- 3 buttons in hero (confusing)
- Long paragraphs everywhere
- Teaching details don't belong on homepage
- Publications buried (should be prominent)

### ❌ POOR FLOW
- No clear path for visitors
- Everything looks equally important
- Redundant content (collaboration mentioned twice)
- Too much scrolling required

### ❌ WEAK FIRST IMPRESSION
- Small hero photo (180px)
- Long tagline (hard to scan)
- Credentials dump (boring)
- No clear value proposition

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: SIMPLIFY TO 4 SECTIONS

### Recommended Structure (Option 1: Minimalist)

```
1. HERO (Above fold)
   - Large photo (250px)
   - Short tagline (5-7 words)
   - Quick credentials (one line)
   - 2 buttons only

2. QUICK STATS (3 cards)
   - 2+ Papers Published
   - 3 Research Environments
   - 13+ Years Teaching

3. PUBLICATIONS (2 cards)
   - IEEE PRML 2024
   - UKCI 2023
   - Visual badges
   - Clear links

4. CURRENT RESEARCH (1 project)
   - Featured ongoing project
   - Image + brief description
   - Link to portfolio

5. COLLABORATION CTA (Simple)
   - One sentence
   - One button
   - Link to page
```

**Total: 5 sections (down from 6), but cleaner**
