## Biography

I am a researcher and lecturer specializing in **intelligent systems** that integrate **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **human-computer interaction**. My research focuses on developing adaptive, privacy-preserving, and sustainable solutions for real-world applications, particularly in social robotics and healthcare technology.

Currently, I serve as a **Lecturer/Researcher at Solent University**, where I teach undergraduate and postgraduate modules in AI, Software Development, and Computer Science. I also conduct research in machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction, with a particular focus on predictive models for social navigation.

## Education

### PhD in Computer Science
**Aston University, United Kingdom**  
**2020 - 2024**

**Thesis:** "Enhancing Robot Social Navigation with Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Predictive Models"

**Supervisor:** Dr. Luis J. Manso  
**Associate Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Aniko Ekart

My PhD research introduced three key contributions to social robot navigation:
1. **Predictive World Models** that enable multi-step ahead predictions
2. **Cosine-Gated LSTM (CGLSTM)** architecture for improved sequential learning
3. **Adaptive Prediction Horizons** that dynamically adjust based on environmental complexity

The research demonstrated superior performance in simulation environments including LunarLander-v2 and SocNavGym, achieving higher success rates and more efficient navigation compared to baseline methods.
