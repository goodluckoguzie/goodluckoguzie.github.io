  <div class="about-content">
    <h2>Hello, I'm Goodluck Oguzie</h2>
    <p>I'm an AI Researcher and Lecturer specializing in machine learning, social robotics, and human-computer interaction. My expertise lies in developing intelligent systems that integrate computer vision, machine learning, and predictive models for real-world applications.</p>
    <p>Currently serving as Lecturer/Researcher at Solent University in the United Kingdom, I teach undergraduate and postgraduate modules in AI, Software Development, and Computer Science while conducting research in reinforcement learning, neural network architectures, and social robot navigation. My research has resulted in two conference publications (UKCI 2023, IEEE PRML 2024) and a completed PhD thesis on "Enhancing Robot Social Navigation with Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Predictive Models".</p>
    <p>I specialize in developing novel algorithms and architectures for sequential learning, predictive modeling for social navigation, and building practical applications that integrate modern web technologies with geographic information systems. My approach combines theoretical development with hands-on implementation, creating solutions that address real-world challenges while maintaining rigorous evaluation and validation standards.</p>
