## Conference Papers

### Predictive World Models for Social Navigation
**Goodluck Oguzie**  
*UKCI 2023 - UK Conference on Intelligent Systems*  
2023

**Abstract:** This paper presents predictive world models for social navigation, enabling autonomous systems to navigate safely in environments with humans. We propose a framework that predicts human behavior and adapts navigation strategies accordingly.

### Cosine Gated LSTM for Sequential Learning
**Goodluck Oguzie**  
*Conference/Journal*  
2023/2024

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel Cosine Gated LSTM architecture that uses cosine gating mechanisms for improved sequential learning. The architecture demonstrates superior performance in complex sequential data processing tasks.
