# Welcome!

I conduct research on **intelligent systems** that integrate **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **human-computer interaction** to support independent living and technological advancement. My work spans predictive world models for social navigation, neural network architectures (including Cosine Gated LSTM), and healthcare technology applications. Across these directions, I focus on developing adaptive, privacy-preserving, and sustainable systems that promote user trust and comfort.
